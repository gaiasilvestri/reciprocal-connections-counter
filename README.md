Reciprocal connections counter
Proportion of reciprocal to non reciprocal connections counter
-----
This program displays the number of reciprocal connections in a spiking neural network as synapses get increasingly added amongst its neurons.
It displays excitatory-inhibitory, inhibitory-inhibitory and excitatory-excitatory counts, so we can compare them as the network becomes increasingly connected up.

It displays the proportion of reciprocal to non reciprocal connections as well. Reciprocal E-E to non-reciprocal E-E, Reciprocal I-I to non-reciprocal I-I, Reciprocal E-I/I-E to non-reciprocal E-I/I-E proportions are plotted separately over time for comparison.
