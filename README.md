Reciprocal connections counter
-----
This program displays the number of reciprocal connections in a spiking neural network as synapses get increasingly added amongst its neurons.
It displays excitatory-inhibitory, inhibitory-inhibitory and excitatory-excitatory counts, so we can compare them.

It displays the proportion of reciprocal to non reciprocal connections as well. E-E, I-I, E-I proportions are plotted separately for comparison.
